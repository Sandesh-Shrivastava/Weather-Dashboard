# Weather-Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a real-time web application developed using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and H2 Database. The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and display conditions for multiple cities. It is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and insightful, helping users get up-to-date weather information along with historical records.

This project demonstrates my skills in Java-based full-stack development, API integration, database management, and responsive UI design.

## 🚀 Features

🌍 City Search Functionality – Users can search for any city worldwide to view real-time weather conditions.

🌡️ Dynamic Weather Updates – Displays temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions fetched directly from the OpenWeatherMap API.

📊 Historical Data Storage – Uses Spring Data JPA with H2 Database to store previously searched weather data.

📱 Mobile-Friendly Interface – Designed with Thymeleaf templates and responsive UI to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

⚡ Fast Performance – Built on Spring Boot with efficient API calls and optimized backend logic.

🔔 Weather Alerts – Provides timely weather insights that can help users prepare for different conditions.
